# Loan-Risk-Prediction-Model
This project develops a predictive model to evaluate loan approval or risk scores based on customer data. It focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, and analyzing patterns to improve model accuracy in predicting loan outcomes.

## Description
This project analyzes a loan approval dataset comprising 20,000 records of personal and financial data. The main goal is to build predictive models to determine whether loan applicants are likely to be approved or denied for a loan. The dataset includes diverse features, such as demographic information, credit history, employment status, income levels, and existing debt, providing a robust foundation for data-driven analysis and decision-making.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset includes the following columns:
